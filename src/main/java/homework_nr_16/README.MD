# Homework nr 16.

Create a Java program that performs the following tasks:
Read data from an input file named "input.txt".
The file should contain the following records: 

- `John,25,85.5`
- `Alice,28,92.0`
- `Bob,22,75.5`
- `Eve,30,88.5`
- `Charlie,27,80.0`

Process the data to perform the following tasks:
Calculate the average score of all persons. 
Identify the youngest and oldest person in the data.

Write the results in the output file named "output.txt" of the following format:
- `Average score: 84.3 `
- `Youngest person: Bob (Age: 22) `
- `Oldest person: Willow (Age: 30)`

4. The program should handle exceptions and errors related to file input and output, 
such as FileNotFoundException or IOException. Be sure to use correct exception processing.
